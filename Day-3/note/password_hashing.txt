Terminologies:  Hashing, Salting
A hash functÂ° is computationally infeasible. If we consider a meat grinder as a hash function, any meat that it has grind once ground can't be back as a piece.
Numerous ways exist to hash a password: 
- Salting is the process of addx any random but unique string to a pwd be4 hashx it.

- Hashing  passwords with bcrypt; the pwd is automatically salted and hached. This method is quite simple to use and is secured.
- Else if, crypto.subtle; this is a web crypto API in an async mode. This method is 
a basic for standard web & asynchronous
-Else, with Argon2; it's haching algorithm is recommended by OWASP which is Open Web Application Security Project.

How it fxns:
- as the user enters his pwd, with respect to the method used (bcrypt, crypto.subtle, Argon2) a salt is generated for that enterred pwd.
- then concatenated to that password and hashed.
- the result is stored in the db.

More oftenly, we say: we're hashing a salted pwd. This is as such since saltx is an integral part of the pwd process.
